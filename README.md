# Litterbot
## A brief description
This is a robot that helps clean up the streets, coupled with a website for reporting rubbish. This project was created for the CodeSec National Finals 2022, around the topic of the Environmental Sector.

When we designed our website, we had one goal: clean, simple UI that was nice to look at. We settled on a dark theme by default to be relaxing to the eyes, but with colours that were not too dark to avoid a clich√©d appearance. For those that like brighter colours, we added an option to toggle to day mode.

As you can see with the password, autofill remembers your username and password (although the username was taken out for this demonstration), and your password is hidden for security. If you already have an account, you can simply click "Log In" after filling in your details, and you are in!
