When we designed our website, we had one goal: clean, simple UI that was nice to look at. We settled on a dark theme by default to be relaxing to the eyes, but with colours that were not too dark to avoid a clich√©d appearance. For those that like brighter colours, we added an option to toggle to day mode:

If you are not logged in, you can click on the login button:

![This image of the login button is not loading](readme-pics/login-highlight.png)

Which will take you to the login screen:

![This image of the login screen is not loading](readme-pics/login-screen.png)

As you can see with the password, autofill remembers your username and password (although the username was taken out for this demonstration), and your password is hidden for security. If you already have an account, you can simply click "Log In" after filling in your details, and you are in!

However, if you do not have an account, you can click on the signup button:

![This image of the signup button is not loading](readme-pics/signup-highlight.png)

Which will take you to the signup screen:

![This image of the signup screen is not loading](readme-pics/signup-screen.png)

Here you can fill in your signup details, and submit the form via the "Sign Up!" button:

![This image of the signup button is not loading](readme-pics/signup-button.png)

This will take you to a verification screen to verify that it is actually you trying to signup:

An email looking like this:

![This image of the verification email is not loading](readme-pics/verification-email.png)

Will be sent to an you and you can enter the 6 digit code:

![This image of the verification code is not loading](readme-pics/code.png)

To verify your account and complete the signup process. The email has been styled using HTML and CSS in a similar way to the website. If you have not received the email, you can click the resend email button:

![This image of the resend verification email is not loading](readme-pics/resend-email.png)

You can then go back and log in!

After logging in, there are two things that you can do:
- Click your profile button on the home page (where the login button used to be):

 ![This image of the profile button is not loading](readme-pics/profile-button.png)

 To view your profile, with information such as the number of reports that you have submitted:

 ![This image of the profile is not loading](readme-pics/profile.png)

 You can click the eye button:

 ![This image of the eye button is not loading](readme-pics/eye-button.png)

 To reveal your password, and also delete your account using the delete acount button:

 ![This image of the delete account button is not loading](readme-pics/delete-account-button.png)

 You will need to enter your password in the popup that appears:

 ![This image of the delete account popup is not loading](readme-pics/delete-account-popup.png)

 To successfully delete your account.

- The second thing that you can do is submit a report of litter in your area, but you will need to make sure that geolocation services are enabled on you web browser. If you are not sure how to do this, you can use [this](https://whatismyipaddress.com/enabling-and-disabling-geolocation-on-your-browser) tutorial to find out how.

 All you need to do is click the submit report button:

 ![This image of the submit report button is not loading](readme-pics/submit-report-button.png)

 And you will automatically send a report our servers with your location. Do note however, that there is a 5 minute cooldown on this report:
